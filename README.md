# README #

AlleleFrequency contains a python script, extractAlleleInfo.py, to calculate allele frequencies from a SNP vcf file.
A Jupyter notebook, calcAlleleFreq.ipynb, is included for plotting and visualising the output data.

### How do I get set up? ###

requires: 
pyVCF (https://github.com/jamescasbon/PyVCF)
& input SNP file in vcf format.

** Input is currently hardcoded (list of samples must also be hardcoded + output file name)
